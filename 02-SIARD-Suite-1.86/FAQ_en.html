    <h2><a name="1">Where can I get the current version of <em>SIARD Suite</em>?</a></h2>
    <p><em>SIARD Suite</em> was developed by the <a href="http://www.bar.admin.ch/">Swiss Federal Archives</a> and is furnished free of charge to any interested party.</p>
    <p>The current version can be ordered from the <a href="http://www.bar.admin.ch/dienstleistungen/00823/00825/index.html?lang=en">SIARD Download page</a>.</p>
     <h2><a name="2">Why can I not open a SIARD file using WinZip?</a></h2>
     <p>SIARD files are stored in the ZIP64 format as described in the documentation of the SIARD format. This format is a successor of the common ZIP format (version 4.5) developed by the company <em>PkWare</em>. Most ZIP utilities available today only support the common ZIP (32-Bit) format. The ZIP32 format is not suitable for the archival of databases, because it is limited to the maximum size of 4GB and 64k contained files.</p>
<p>SIARD files can be opened using PKZIP from <em>PkWare</em>.</p>
<p>There is an open source command-line utility published by Enter AG under <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zip64file/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/zip64file/</a> which permits extracting and compressing of ZIP64 files.</p>
    <h2><a name="3">Why do I need to always archive the whole database? Why can I not select the tables I want to archive?</a></h2>
    <p>The "whole database" is the collection of all objects that the database user has read access to. A general way of designating tables to be archived or skipped would be very cumbersome. The access control subsystem of the database system does a much better job of presenting a consistent view to each user.</p>
    <p>To exclude some tables from archival just create an archival user with read access limited to the tables that should be archived. Use this archival user for downloading the database using <em>SiardFromDb</em> or <em>SiardEdit</em>.</p>
    <h2><a name="4">Why can I not select the table columns to be archived?</a></h2>
    <p>The most flexible selection is very complex to describe. Instead we recommend to describe the material to be archived in VIEWS using SQL and "realise" those view in separate tables to which the archival user has read access.</p>
    <h2><a name="5">Why does SIARD not archive CHECK constraints, TRIGGERS, VIEW queries oder ROUTINE sources?</a></h2>
    <p>The SIARD format was designed for long-term database preservation. The database objects CHECK, TRIGGER, VIEW and ROUTINE were included because they are part of the SQL standard and other programs producing SIARD files may want to fill them for informative purposes. <em>SIARD Suite</em> created those database objects to the extent they are accessible in the database system through JDBC.</p>
    <p>To serve its main purpose of long-term preservation of database data <em>SIARD Suite</em> makes sure that the content of the base tables and the metadata describing the database structure is preserved most faithfully. Preserving action metadata (TRIGGER, ROUTINE) that change the data and queries that are formulated in the idiosyncratic SQL dialect of the database system (CHECK constraints, VIEW queries) is considered of secondary importance and are only archived if they are accessible as long as no existing database system supports the standards that should be able to run on all other SQL:1999 conformant database systems.</p>
    <p><em><strong>We want to archive data rather than code.</strong></em></p>
    <p>Otherwise we could start archiving all of the applicatory code (in C/C++, JAVA,Python, VB.NET, Ruby ...)!</p>
<h2><a name="6">Why does SIARD slow down when downloading large databases?</a></h2>
<p><em>SIARD Suite</em> was designed to be able to archive any database of any size with limited JAVA memory. (There is one exception: The whole structural metadata must fit into memory. If you have a database with very many e.g. thousands of tables and columns, you may have to start the JVM with a larger heap.)</p>
   <p><em>SiardEdit</em> does offer the download functionality but is not suited for the download of large databases because the output is displayed in GUI window, which fills up the JAVA heap and makes the process slower, the larger the displayed output has become.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why the command-line utilities <em>SiardFromDb</em> and <em>SiardToDb</em> were developed. These utilities are not subjected to this problem of a growing heap, because they write their output to <em>stdout</em> or <em>stderr</em>.</p>
    <p>With these utilities a constant download speed is achieved which does not depend on the size of the database but is mainly limited by the bandwidth of the network and the speed of the database server.</p>
    <h2><a name="7">Why does SIARD not store any primary keys, foreign keys or VIEWS when archiving MS Access files?</a></h2>
    <p><em>SIARD Suite</em> can only archive what the database system permits to extract. MS Access has no concept of a primary key but treats all candidate (unique) keys the same. In many cases <em>SIARD Suite</em> succeeds in guessing the name of the primary key (e.g. the standard name "PrimaryKey", but that differs from on Windows locale language to the other!) but success cannot be garanteed.</p>
    <p>If the system tables MSysObjects, MSysQueries and MSysReferences could not be made accessible to <em>SIARD Suite</em> - e.g. for .accdb files - then information about foreign keys and VIEWS cannot be archived.</p>
    <h2><a name="8">What kind of support is available for <em>SIARD Suite</em>?</a></h2>
    <p>The <em>Swiss Federal Archives</em> have authorized the developers of <em>SIARD Suite</em> at <a href="http://www.enterag.ch/">Enter AG in Zurich</a> to offer support contracts to other institutions.</p>
    <h2><a name="9">Can <em>SIARD Suite</em> be translated to other languages?</a></h2>
    <p>Technically <em>SIARD Suite</em> can be augmented to support any number of additional user languages. An application for support of a new language must be submitted to the Swiss Federal Archives.</p> 
    <h2><a name="10">Why does <em>SIARD Suite</em> not support any other database systems?</a></h2>
    <p>In principle there is no limit to the number of database systems that could be supported by <em>SIARD Suite</em> as long as a JDBC driver exists, to access the database. Unfortunately the various database systems support very different, incompatible versions of SQL-92. (In 2010 there does not exist a single database system yet which conforms to the SQL:1999 standard! Obviously the producers of these systems are motivated to chain their users to their products.)</p>
    <p>Therefore every new database system must be integrated to <em>SIARD Suite</em> "manually". In spite of separation of generic database code and the proprietary databases no clean global interface to "external" new database systems can be defined, that will handle all specialties of real database systems.</p>
    <p>The Swiss Federal Archives keep adding support for new database systems. If you have a particular need, please let them know!</p>
