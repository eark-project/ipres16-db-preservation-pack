# Sakila sample database

To set up this database, you will need access to a MySQL (or MariaDB) system. After aquiring access to that system, you may follow the instructions at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html to install the sample database.

## Differences from original Sakila database

The `sakila-schema.sql` in the same directory of this README file includes descriptions (comments/remarks) for columns and tables. You can use the original file, but then the installed database will not include descriptions.

The `sakila-data.sql` file has been included in the same directory of this README file, but was not modified.

The `sakila.mwb` file has not been included.

## More information

For more information see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/ or the `sakila-info.pdf` file in the same directory of this README file.
